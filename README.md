# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
#### Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### Factory Method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

#### Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

#### Prototype
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

#### Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


## Structural Patterns
#### Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
