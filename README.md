# Design Patterns
My learning notes and exercises on design patterns.

## Creational Patterns
#### Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

#### Factory Method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

#### Prototype a.k.a Clone
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

#### Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


## Structural Patterns
#### Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

#### Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

#### Composite
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

#### Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

#### Flyweight a.k.a Cache
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

#### Proxy
Provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.


## Behavioral Patterns
#### Chain of Responsibility
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

#### Command
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

#### Iterator
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

#### Mediator
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and
it lets you vary their interaction independently.

#### Memento
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

#### Observer
A subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

#### Observer a.k.a publish-subscribe
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Relationships
#### Decorator vs Proxy
* Decorator informs and empowers its client
* Proxy restricts and disempowers its client

#### Command vs Mediator vs Observer
Command establishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.
Mediator eliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.
Observer lets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.

## Support Principles
S.O.L.I.D. Principles of Object Oriented Class Design

#### Single-responsibility principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
#### Open-closed principle
A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Liskov substitution principle
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

#### Interface segregation principle
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
